<b>Motivation</b><br>
Applying effective cyber deception techniques to Malware requires a high-level characterization of its behavior.  <br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b> <br>
Developing a model that identifies the behavior of Win32 APIs traces from a malware by linking them to specific techniques in ATT&CK.<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b> <br>
1- Building a tool, SODA, that automatically applies deception techniques to Malware using API hooking. <br>
2- Collecting Win32 API-related data from MSDN, Stack Overflow, and GitHub in a code-description dataset to leverage it in a weakly supervised learning approach <br>
3- Training a model that uses statistical analysis and language models to analyze an API trace and characterize it to a specific TTP from ATT&CK. <br>
