<b>Motivation</b> <br>
ATT&CK is a knowledge base that categorizes real-world attack activities into tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). <br>
CVE is a list of disclosed vulnerabilities in public software and CTI reports are reports that provide technical analysis of real-world attacks. <br>  
Mapping CVE and CTI reports to ATT&CK enriches them with additional context, accelerates threat response, and facilitates collaboration and information sharing among organizations.<br>
<br>

<b>Objective</b><br>
Build a tool that automatically maps CVE and CTI reports to appropriate ATT&CK techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>Challenges</b><br>
1- Complexity of CVE and CTI reports<br>
2- Semantic gap between technical description and high-level attack categorization<br>
3- Scarcity of useful data<br>
4- High number of classes (~600 techniques) and an imbalance of data among classes<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b><br>
1- Automatically collecting representative key phrases from ATT&CK's using semantic role labeling<br>
2- Finetune a language model using the SIAMESE network to maximize the cosine similarity between phrases extracted from the same techniques and maximize it otherwise<br>
3- Using the finetuned language model to extract semantically rich embedding of attack sentences and training logistic regression to classify the attack sentences to techniques.<br>
