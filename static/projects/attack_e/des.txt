<b>Motivation</b> <br>
cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports are the key resource for understanding and communicating cyber threat information. <br>
Analyzing CTI reports to identify useful information for security analysts requires substantial time and efforts.  <br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b> <br>
Building a tool that automatically converts CTI reports to structured information in the form of an attack graph that contains the sequence of attack actions, their means and their tactical objectives<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b> <br>
1- Training deep learning and transformer models to identify attack procedures from the report.<br>
2- Training semi-supervised learning techniques to categorize attack procedures.<br>
3- Leveraging semantic role labeling to extract the relationship between attack procedures. <br>
4- Leveraging dependency trees and named entity recognition tools to extract attributes of attacker artifacts<br>
